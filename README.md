# Rice/Paddy Leaf Diease Detection using Deep Learning


Agricultural sector plays a crucial role for economic development of any country. In terms 
of raw materials, the majority of countries are dependent on agricultural goods. Paddy is mostly 
cultivated crop around the globe. Paddy is cultivated in over 100 countries around the world. A 
total of 158 million hectares are harvested each year, yielding more than 700 million tons of rice. 
In comparison to other continents, Asia produces the majority of Paddy. Because of increasing 
population it is affecting environment in terms of global warming, rapid climatic shifts Yadav et 
al. (2021).
Photos leaves from rice plants are taken with a digital camera or similar unit, and the images are 
used to classify the affected region in the leaves. To detect disease in rice leaves, we use a 
Convolution neural network and a Deep neural network in the proposed framework. This paper 
proposes a framework that employs low cost, open- source software to achieve the task of reliably 
detecting plant disease.

## Problem Statement
To detect the disease present in Rice leaf using Image Processing and Deep Learning techniques. 
##Features of the project
- Use of Deep learning algorithms.
- The model used is CNN model.
- The algorithm used is Supervised Learning Algorithm on backpropagation for training.
- Use of Flask for Creating the Application programming interfaces i.e., APIs along with jinja2 templating.
- Static Webpages are created for showing the result/prediction of the rice leaf disease with the use of frontend technologies like HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
- The model acuuracy is 90%.
- The training and testing ration provided is 8:2 which may cause overfitting of the model.
- However during the testing of dataset, we have provided the dataset of our own.

## Our Contribution
Created our own dataset. for this project we have implemented the datasets from the kaggle as well as our own dataset.
Creation of web pages.
